# Shadow Catcher Plugin C4D

## Description

**What does the shadow catcher plugin allow?**

Here is the scenario, we have a 3D character walking across the floor while casting a shadow. We want to composite this with an image in photoshop. Using shadow catcher we can render the character and shadow (with alpha) without the floor which can be very useful.

See basic example tutorial [here](https://grafxflow.co.uk/blog/3d-animation/shadow-catcher-plugin-in-cinema-4d)

> NOTE: It has been tested in **Cinema 4D R9** through to **Cinema 4D R17**.

> UPDATE: **Shadow catcher** is now a built-in material and compositing feature in version **Cinema 4D R18+** by default.
